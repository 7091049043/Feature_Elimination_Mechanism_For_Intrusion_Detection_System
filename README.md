# Feature_Elimination_Mechanism_For_Intrusion_Detection_System
 Enhanced the efficiency of our Intrusion Detection System by identifying and selecting relevant features in a large dataset,leading to increase in accuracy and reduction in processing time.Utilized a Recursive Feature Elimination process in conjunction with a Decision Tree classifier to accurately identify and eliminate irrelevant features .
